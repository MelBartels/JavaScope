Subject: ScopeII Macintosh install procedure

Hey Mel
I installed ScopeII from the CD and went thru the
install procedure in the manual.  I am not sure if
this changed from early RXTX or MacOS X versions but
now, the install procedure should be (for Tiger
anyway):

Getting Started on the MAC
 
Install all the files on the CD to a chosen directory.
  You can remove all the files with an extension of
".bat and .exe" since these are only for Windoze
installation. 

Move the RXTXcomm.jar and metouia.jar files to /Library/Java/Extensions/.

You will need to get file librxtxSerial.jnilib from www.rxtx.org website. Download the latest package.  As of now, it is
labeled: Wed Mar 1 2006 RXTX 2.1-7r2.  Click on "RXTX
2.1-7r2" to download the package.
In the pacakge find file: ~rxtx-2.1-7r2/MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install/Library/Java/Extensions/librxtxSerial.jnilib

copy file "librxtxSerial.jnilib" to
/Library/Java/Extensions/.

 At a command line, launch ‘java -cp scope.jar scope’.
 
///end install instructions

Thats the best install procedure i could come up with.
 I do not see how this could have ever run without librxtxSerial.jnilib.  Maybe nobody used it on the Mac?

Anyway, I have it up and running but not connected to
the servo controller.  I don't have a handpad at the
moment so don't have a lot of motivation to setup the
dob and give it a go.

Hope this help, please let me know if there is an
easier way, its the only way i could get to work.  Not
having librxtxSerial.jnilib was a real bear to figure
out!
